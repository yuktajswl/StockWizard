## Dataset
- Source: [Insert source name or link]
- Format: CSV containing daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Frequency: Daily time series

---

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI)
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training (Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Model Evaluation (MSE, R² Score)
6. Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Prices
